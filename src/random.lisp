;;;; ** Random (QuickCheck-ish) testing

;;;; FiveAM provides the ability to automatically generate a
;;;; collection of random input data for a specific test and run a
;;;; test multiple times.

;;;; Specification testing is done through the FOR-ALL macro. This
;;;; macro will bind variables to random data and run a test body a
;;;; certain number of times. Should the test body ever signal a
;;;; failure we stop running and report what values of the variables
;;;; caused the code to fail.

;;;; The generation of the random data is done using "generator
;;;; functions" (see below for details). A generator function is a
;;;; function which creates, based on user supplied parameters, a
;;;; function which returns random data. In order to facilitate
;;;; generating good random data the FOR-ALL macro also supports guard
;;;; conditions and creating one random input based on the values of
;;;; another (see the FOR-ALL macro for details).

;;;; *** Public Interface to the Random Tester

(defparameter *num-trials* 100
  "Number of times we attempt to run the body of the FOR-ALL test.")

(defparameter *max-trials* 10000
  "Number of total times we attempt to run the body of the
  FOR-ALL test including when the body is skipped due to failed
  guard conditions.

Since we have guard conditions we may get into infinite loops
where the test code is never run due to the guards never
returning true. This second run limit prevents that.")

(defmacro for-all (bindings &body body)
  "Bind BINDINGS to random variables and test BODY *num-trials* times.

BINDINGS is a list of binding forms, each element is a list
of (BINDING VALUE &optional GUARD). Value, which is evaluated
once when the for-all is evaluated, must return a generator which
be called each time BODY is evaluated. BINDING is either a symbol
or a list which will be passed to destructuring-bind. GUARD is a
form which, if present, stops BODY from executing when IT returns
NIL. The GUARDS are evaluated after all the random data has been
generated and they can refer to the current value of any
binding. NB: Generator forms, unlike guard forms, can not contain
references to the bound variables.

Examples:

  (for-all ((a (gen-integer)))
    (is (integerp a)))

  (for-all ((a (gen-integer) (plusp a)))
    (is (integerp a))
    (is (plusp a)))

  (for-all ((less (gen-integer))
            (more (gen-integer) (< less more)))
    (is (<= less more)))

  (for-all (((a b) (gen-two-integers)))
    (is (integerp a))
    (is (integerp b)))"
