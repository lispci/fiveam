;;;; ** Fixtures

;;;; When running tests we often need to setup some kind of context
;;;; (create dummy db connections, simulate an http request,
;;;; etc.). Fixtures provide a way to conviently hide this context
;;;; into a macro and allow the test to focus on testing.

;;;; NB: A FiveAM fixture is nothing more than a macro. Since the term
;;;; 'fixture' is so common in testing frameworks we've provided a
;;;; wrapper around defmacro for this purpose.

macro but is used only for simple templating. A fixture created
with DEF-FIXTURE is a macro which can use the special macrolet
&BODY to specify where the body should go.
