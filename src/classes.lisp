Test suites serve to organize tests into groups so that the
developer can chose to run some tests and not just one or
all. Like tests test suites have a name and a description.

Test suites, like tests, can be part of other test suites, this
allows the developer to create a hierarchy of tests where sub
trees can be singularly run.

Running a test suite has the effect of running every test (or
suite) in the suite."))

checks.

A test case is the smallest organizational element which can be
run individually. Every test case has a name, which is a symbol,
a description and a test lambda. The test lambda is a regular
funcall'able function which should use the various checking
macros to collect results.

Every test case is part of a suite, when a suite is not
explicitly specified (either via the :SUITE parameter to the TEST
macro or the global variable *SUITE*) the test is inserted into
the global suite named NIL.

Sometimes we want to run a certain test only if another test has
passed. FiveAM allows us to specify the ways in which one test is
dependent on another.

- AND Run this test only if all the named tests passed.

- OR Run this test if at least one of the named tests passed.

- NOT Run this test only if another test has failed.

FiveAM considers a test to have passed if all the checks executed
were successful, otherwise we consider the test a failure.

When a test is not run due to it's dependencies having failed a
test-skipped result is added to the results."))
