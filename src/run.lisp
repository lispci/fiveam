;;;; * Running Tests

;;;; Once the programmer has defined what the tests are these need to
;;;; be run and the expected effects should be compared with the
;;;; actual effects. FiveAM provides the function RUN for this
;;;; purpose, RUN executes a number of tests and collects the results
;;;; of each individual check into a list which is then
;;;; returned. There are three types of test results: passed, failed
;;;; and skipped, these are represented by TEST-RESULT objects.

;;;; Generally running a test will return normally, but there are two
;;;; exceptional situations which can occur:

;;;; - An exception is signaled while running the test. If the
;;;;   variable *debug-on-error* is T than FiveAM will enter the
;;;;   debugger, otherwise a test failure (of type
;;;;   unexpected-test-failure) is returned. When entering the
;;;;   debugger two restarts are made available, one simply reruns the
;;;;   current test and another signals a test-failure and continues
;;;;   with the remaining tests.

;;;; - A circular dependency is detected. An error is signaled and a
;;;;   restart is made available which signals a test-skipped and
;;;;   continues with the remaining tests. This restart also sets the
;;;;   dependency status of the test to nil, so any tests which depend
;;;;   on this one (even if the dependency is not circular) will be
;;;;   skipped.

;;;; The functions RUN!, !, !! and !!! are convenient wrappers around
;;;; RUN and EXPLAIN.
