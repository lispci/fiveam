;;;; * Tests

;;;; While executing checks and collecting the results is the core job
;;;; of a testing framework it is also important to be able to
;;;; organize checks into groups, fiveam provides two mechanisms for
;;;; organizing checks: tests and test suites. A test is a named
;;;; collection of checks which can be run and a test suite is a named
;;;; collection of tests and test suites.

NAME (a symbol)::
  The name of the test.

SUITE (a test name)::
  The suite to put the test under. It defaults to *SUITE* (which
  itself defaults to the default global suite).

FIXTURE::
  The name of the fixture to use for this test. See `WITH-FIXTURE` for
  details on fixtures.

COMPILE-AT (a keyword)::
  When the body of this test should be compiled. By default, or when
  `:compile-at` is `:run-time`, test bodies are only compiled before
  they are run. Set this to to `:definition-time` to force
  compilation, and errors/warnings, to be done at compile time.

DEPENDS-ON::
  A list, or a symbol, which specifies the relationship between this
  test and other tests. These conditions, `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` can be
  combined to produce complex dependencies (whethere this is something
  you should actually be doing is a question for another day).

  `(and &rest TEST-NAMES)`:::
    This test is run only if all of the tests in TEST-NAMES have
    passed, otherwise a single test-skipped result is generated.

  `(or &rest TEST-NAMES)`:::
    If any of TEST-NAMES has passed this test is run, otherwise a
    test-skipped result is generated.

  `(NOT TEST-NAME`:::
    This is test is run only if TEST-NAME failed.

  __a-symbol__:::
    Shorthand for `(AND a-symbol)`

PROFILE::
  When non-`NIL` profiling information will be collected as well."
