;;;; * Tests

;;;; While executing checks and collecting the results is the core job
;;;; of a testing framework it is also important to be able to
;;;; organize checks into groups, fiveam provides two mechanisms for
;;;; organizing checks: tests and test suites. A test is a named
;;;; collection of checks which can be run and a test suite is a named
;;;; collection of tests and test suites.
