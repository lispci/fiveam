;;;; * Test Suites

;;;; Test suites allow us to collect multiple tests into a single
;;;; object and run them all using asingle name. Test suites do not
;;;; affect the way test are run nor the way the results are handled,
;;;; they are simply a test organizing group.

;;;; Test suites can contain both tests and other test suites. Running
;;;; a test suite causes all of its tests and test suites to be
;;;; run. Suites do not affect test dependencies, running a test suite
;;;; can cause tests which are not in the suite to be run.

NAME::
  The symbol naming the test.

DESCRIPTION::
  A string describing the contents/purpose of this suite.

IN (a symbol)::
  If provided, causes this suite te be nested in the suite named by
  `IN`. If `IN` is `NIL`, as opposed to not being passed at all, the
  new suite will not be a part of any existing suite.

FIXTURE::
  Whatever value is passed here will be passed, unevaluated, to all
  tests defined in this suite.

This macro is built on top of `make-suite` and  it, just like `make-suite`,
will overrwrite any existing suite named `NAME`."
